        spiral galaxies visible, but also one of the dustiest.  Dubbed the Silver
        Coin for its appearance in smalltelescopes, it is more formally known as the
        Sculptor Galaxy for its location within the boundaries of the southern constellation
        Sculptor.  Discovered in 1783 by mathematician and astronomer Caroline Herschel,
        the dusty island universe lies a mere 10 million light-years away. About 70
        thousand light-years across, NGC 253, pictured, is the largest member of the
        Sculptor Group of Galaxies, the nearest to our own Local Group of galaxies.  In
        addition to its spiral dust lanes, tendrils of dust seem to be rising from
        a galactic disk laced with young star clusters and star forming regions in
        this sharp color image. The high dust content accompanies frantic star formation,
        earning NGC 253 the designation of a starburst galaxy. NGC 253 is also known
        to be a strong source of high-energy x-rays and gamma rays, likely due to
        massive black holes near the galaxy''s center. Take a trip through extragalactic
