      string: '{"date":"2020-04-13","explanation":"How did this big rock end up on
        this strange terrain? One of the more unusual places here on Earth occurs
        inside Death Valley, California, USA.  There a dried lakebed named Racetrack
        Playa exists that is almost perfectly flat, with the odd exception of some
        very large stones, one of which is pictured here in April of 2019 beneath
        a dark, Milky-Way filled sky.  Now the flatness and texture of large playa
        like Racetrack are fascinating but not scientifically puzzling -- they are
        caused by mud flowing, drying, and cracking after a heavy rain.  Only recently,
        however, has a viable scientific hypothesis been given to explain how heavy  sailing
        stones end up near the middle of such a large flat surface.  Unfortunately,
        as frequently happens in science, a seemingly surreal problem ends up having
        a relatively mundane solution.  It turns out that in winter thin ice sheets
        form, and winds push ice sections laden with even heavy rocks across the temporarily
        slick playa when sunlight melts the ice.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2004/SailingStone_Burke_1366.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A
